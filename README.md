# Project Inertia

Godot 4 project demonstrating basic 3D node setup and physics interactions.

## Overview

This repository contains a small Godot project (scene and scripts) intended
as a starting point for learning inertia and movement behaviors in 3D.

## Contents

- `project.godot` — Godot project file
- `node_3d.gd` — Main GDScript for the 3D node
- `icon.svg` — Project icon

## Requirements

- Godot 4.x

## Setup

1. Open Godot and choose "Import" or "Open" and select this folder.
2. Run the project from the Godot editor.

## Development

- Make edits to `node_3d.gd` and test in-editor.
- Commit changes and push to GitHub (see example commands below).

## Example Git commands

For a fresh repository (PowerShell):

## Want help?

If you'd like, I can add a `CONTRIBUTING.md`, example scenes, or CI steps
to export builds. Tell me which and I'll add them.
